# CDM Theme Customization Guide

## üé® Custom Themes

**Cross Platform Download Manager (CDM)** supports custom themes that allow you to personalize the application's appearance according to your preferences. You can either use the built-in themes or create your own from scratch.

### Available Themes

We provide two default themes:

1. **Dark Theme** - Ideal for low-light environments
2. **Light Theme** - Optimized for bright environments

You can download these theme files from the [Themes folder on GitHub](https://github.com/adel-bakhshi/CrossPlatformDownloadManager/tree/master/CrossPlatformDownloadManager.DesktopApp/Assets/Themes).

## üõ† Creating Custom Themes

### Theme File Structure

CDM themes are JSON files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "themeName": "YourThemeName",
  "isDarkTheme": true/false,
  "primaryColor": {
    "brushMode": 0,
    "color": "#HEXCODE",
    "opacity": 1
  },
  // Other color settings...
}
```

### Steps to Create a Custom Theme:

1. **Download an existing theme** (preferably one closest to your desired look)
2. **Open the file with a text editor** (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.)
3. **Modify the color values**:
   - Each color uses HEX code (e.g., `#FFFFFF` for white)
   - You can use tools like [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) to create color palettes
4. **Change the theme name** (edit the `themeName` field)
5. **Save the file** (with `.json` extension)

### Example Color Modification:

To change the primary color, edit this section:

```json
"primaryColor": {
  "brushMode": 0,
  "color": "#131213",  // Change this value
  "opacity": 1
}
```

## üé® Advanced Customization

CDM themes support these advanced features:

### Gradients

You can create gradient effects for certain elements:

```json
"primaryGradientBrush": {
  "brushMode": 1,
  "startPoint": "0,0.5",
  "endPoint": "1,0.5",
  "gradientStops": [
    {
      "offset": 0,
      "color": {
        "brushMode": 0,
        "color": "#007BFF",
        "opacity": 1
      }
    },
    // Additional gradient points...
  ]
}
```

### Opacity

Control element transparency by adjusting the `opacity` value (range: 0 to 1).
