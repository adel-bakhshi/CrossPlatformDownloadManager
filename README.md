## üì• Installation

Getting started with **Cross Platform Download Manager (CDM)** is simple! Follow these steps to install both the main application and the browser extension.

### **1. Install the Main Application**

1. Visit the [Releases Page](https://github.com/adel-bakhshi/CrossPlatformDownloadManager/releases).
2. Download the latest version of CDM for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer or extract the files (depending on your platform).
4. Launch the program and start managing your downloads!

That's it! No additional prerequisites or setup required.

### **2. Install the Browser Extension**

Since we haven't been able to publish the browser extension on the Chrome Web Store due to an embargo, you can manually install it by following these steps:

#### **For Google Chrome and Other Chromium-Based Browsers:**

1. **Download the Extension:** Visit the [Extension Releases Page](https://github.com/adel-bakhshi/cdm-browser-extension/releases) and download the latest `.crx` file.
2. **Open Extensions Settings:** In your browser, navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.

3. **Enable Developer Mode:** Toggle the **Developer Mode** switch located in the top-right corner of the page.

4. **Install the Extension:**

   - Drag and drop the downloaded `.crx` file directly into the extensions page.
   - Alternatively, if you have an unpacked folder containing the extension files, click **Load Unpacked** and select the folder.

5. **You're All Set!** The extension will now be installed and ready to use in your Chromium-based browser.

> **Note:** While this method works for most Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Microsoft Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera), some browsers might have slightly different settings or interfaces. If you encounter any issues, refer to your browser's documentation or let us know by [reporting the issue](https://github.com/adel-bakhshi/cdm-browser-extension/issues).

#### **For Firefox:**

1. **Download the Extension:**  
   Visit the [official Mozilla Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cdm-browser-extension/) and click the **Add to Firefox** button.

2. **Install the Extension:**  
   After clicking **Add to Firefox**, follow the prompts to complete the installation. Once installed, the extension will appear in your list of add-ons.

3. **You're All Set!** The extension will now be installed and ready to use in Firefox.

> **Note:** The Firefox extension is fully supported and maintained under the same GitHub project as the Chromium-based extension: [Github project link](https://github.com/adel-bakhshi/cdm-browser-extension). Release updates are synchronized across both platforms.

---

### Additional Notes:

- Both the Chromium-based and Firefox extensions are built and maintained under the same GitHub project. This ensures consistent functionality and updates across all supported browsers.
- If you encounter any issues during installation or usage, please [report the issue](https://github.com/adel-bakhshi/cdm-browser-extension/issues) so we can assist you.

## üìä Roadmap & Future Plans

We're committed to making CDM better with every update. Here are some ideas we're exploring for future releases:

### **For CDM:**

- **Testing and Publishing for Linux and Mac:** Expand platform support by thoroughly testing and publishing the program for Linux and Mac operating systems, ensuring a seamless experience across all major platforms.
- **Light Theme:** Add a light theme for users who prefer brighter interfaces.
- **Custom Themes:** Allow users to create and apply different themes to personalize their experience.
- **System Notifications:** Implement native system notifications for download completions and errors.
- **Help Section:** Develop an in-app help section to assist users with common questions and troubleshooting.
- **Multilingual Support:** Make the program available in multiple languages to reach a global audience.
- **Right-click menu for System Tray Icon:** Currently, due to some minor issues, the right-click menu for the System Tray Icon is temporarily unavailable. We're working to resolve this soon!

### **For the Browser Extension:**

- **Publishing the Extension:** We are actively working on publishing the extension to the Chrome Web Store. While we've encountered some challenges, your support and patience will help us complete this process.
- **Batch Link Handling:** Enable users to capture and add multiple links at once instead of adding them individually.

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to suggest features you'd like to see!
