## 📥 Installation

Getting started with **Cross Platform Download Manager (CDM)** is simple! Follow these steps to install both the main application and the browser extension.

### **1. Install the Main Application**

1. Visit the [Releases Page](https://github.com/adel-bakhshi/CrossPlatformDownloadManager/releases).
2. Download the latest version of CDM for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer or extract the files (depending on your platform).
4. Launch the program and start managing your downloads!

That's it! No additional prerequisites or setup required.

### **2. Install the Browser Extension**

Since we haven't been able to publish the browser extension on the Chrome Web Store due to an embargo, you can manually install it by following these steps:

#### **For Google Chrome and Other Chromium-Based Browsers:**

1. **Download the Extension:** Visit the [Extension Releases Page](https://github.com/adel-bakhshi/cdm-browser-extension/releases) and download the latest `.crx` file.
2. **Open Extensions Settings:** In your browser, navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.

3. **Enable Developer Mode:** Toggle the **Developer Mode** switch located in the top-right corner of the page.

4. **Install the Extension:**

   - Drag and drop the downloaded `.crx` file directly into the extensions page.
   - Alternatively, if you have an unpacked folder containing the extension files, click **Load Unpacked** and select the folder.

5. **You're All Set!** The extension will now be installed and ready to use in your Chromium-based browser.

> **Note:** While this method works for most Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Microsoft Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera), some browsers might have slightly different settings or interfaces. If you encounter any issues, refer to your browser's documentation or let us know by [reporting the issue](https://github.com/adel-bakhshi/cdm-browser-extension/issues).

#### **For Firefox:**

Firefox support for the extension is **coming soon**! Stay tuned for updates as we work on bringing this functionality to more browsers.
